## **1. Topic**  
Real-time detection of drowsy driving using deep learning  

## **2. Purpose and Objectives**  
- **Purpose:** Prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving, reducing casualties and traffic congestion by detecting driver drowsiness in real-time.  
- **Objective:** Develop a real-time drowsy driving detection system.  

## **3. Project Details**  
- **Review of Previous Studies:** Examined various datasets and modeling techniques for drowsy driving detection.  
- **Topics:**

## **5. Comparison of the Two Models**  

### **1. LSTM-based state detection using time-series analysis of driver facial coordinates**  
- **Advantages:** Predicts drowsiness by analyzing the driverâ€™s state over time, allowing early detection.  
- **Disadvantages:** Has a **4.8-second delay in inference**, preventing immediate action in case of drowsiness.  

### **2. CNN-based drowsiness detection using eye image data**  
- **Advantages:** **High performance** and enables **real-time inference**, allowing immediate response to prevent accidents.  
- **Disadvantages:** Cannot detect drowsiness if the driver wears sunglasses or other accessories that obstruct the eyes.
